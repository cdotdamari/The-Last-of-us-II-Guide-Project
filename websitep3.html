            There are four types of enemies. The game provides the first set of enemies
            as the infected. The infected are a group of enemies that are "infected" with the 
            cordyseps virus and they are dangerous enemies. They consist of Clickers,
             which are infected that are completely blind, but have great hearing and 
             can one hit kill Abby or Ellie if not ready to defend. The next type are the runners,
              the runners are the base enemy and are the closest to human form. They run and attack fast.
               The next set of infected are the Stalkers, they hide in the darkness waiting for
                your guard to go down. Then there are the bloaters which are big tank like 
                enemies along with shamblers which are very similar, but have less health.
                Finally leaving with the Rat King which is a huge amalgumation of Clickers
                into one big enemy. After them we have the 3 groups of
            human enemies WLF, Scars and Rattlers. Each group are very similar, but there are only some key 
            differences. Scars are more primitive and use bows to fight, WLF's use 
            military grade weaponry, and Rattlers use basically anything they can find. They are 
            the "dirty fighters" of the game.

            A lot of people struggle with the Rat King boss fight, There are items 
            across the boss arena that can help you beat it. There are also obstacles to whatch 
            out for while fighting it. Along with the Rat King there is a second phase for the boss 
            battle, a clicker like enemy will part from the main body and act as an extra 
            enemy to distract you to lose. Since this battle is difficult below is an in depth look,
             with some tips on how to beat the rat king fast and with no errors.
