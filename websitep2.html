        Artifacts are a way to pogress through the games hidden story, or through collecting 
        trophies for completion. There are 127 artifacts throughout the game, they can be 
        in many places. The most common artifacts are the ones you get on collecting papers. 
        For Ellie, she has unique artifacts in the form of superhero cards 
        that are from comics her and joel used to collect. Once completely gettin all of the cards 
        you will be awarded a trophy for completing it.

        Just like Ellie, in the game you will be able to collect unique artifacts 
        as Abby too. Abby's artifacts are in the form of coins, which she used to collect with her dad, 
        but after his death she forgot about the days she would collect them with him.
        collecting all of these coins will give you a trophy for completeing the set.
        These coins, just like Ellie's cards can be found all over the map.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white">
            Paper artifacts are also all over the map. These artifacts can be found on walls, 
            on dead bodies, in towers and on desks etc. Artifacts are not a necesity for 
            completion of the game, but are cool things to do on the side when you feel 
            like having a more in deth play though of the game.
